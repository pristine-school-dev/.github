## About Us

Welcome to the Pristine Public School development organization on GitHub! This organization houses the internal projects and development efforts specifically for **Pristine Public School**. Our primary focus is to develop and maintain the **Pristine Pathway** project and its associated documentation.

**Note:** The repositories within this organization are **private** and intended for use by Pristine Public School students, faculty, and staff only. We kindly request that individuals outside of Pristine Public School refrain from attempting to access these resources.

## Our Projects

This organization contains the following private repositories:

*   **Pristine Pathway:** This repository contains the source code for the Pristine Pathway project. (Further details about the project can be added if desired, but keep in mind the audience is internal.)
*   **Pristine Pathway Documentation:** This repository holds the documentation related to the Pristine Pathway project.
*   **Pristine Pathway Packages:** This repository contains the private packages used internally within the Pristine Pathway Project.

**Important:**  These repositories are **private** and not accessible to the public.

## Contributing

Contributions to these projects are limited to students, faculty, and approved staff of Pristine Public School. If you are a member of the Pristine Public School community and wish to contribute, please contact administration for access and guidelines.

Since this is an internal organization, detailed contribution guidelines here are likely unnecessary. Instead, refer contributors to internal resources. For example:

## Code of Conduct

We uphold the highest standards of conduct within our development community. All members of this organization are expected to adhere to the Pristine Public School's code of conduct and guidelines, emphasizing respect, collaboration, and academic integrity.
